# SORvsPoisson

Solving the the weak (variable-coefficient) form of the *Poisson’s* equation,
using the Successive Over Relaxation (SOR) method.

SOR is a numerical method that solves elliptic partial differential equations,
like the *Laplace* or the *Poisson’s* equation. More info at the
```sorvspoisson_report.pdf``` in the current directory.
